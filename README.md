Home Sales Analysis

Overview

This project leverages Apache Spark and PySpark SQL to analyze home sales data stored in an AWS S3 bucket. The dataset contains various attributes of homes, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, square footage, and view ratings.

Through this analysis, we extract insights related to home prices based on different parameters such as the year sold, year built, and view ratings. Additionally, we explore the impact of caching and data partitioning on query performance.
